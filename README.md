## ⚙️ Projects

### PROJECT SMART ENERGY (L1Q1)

- Designed and installed a Smart Meter Gateway in my own meter cabinet.
- Soldered the hardware and flashed the software independently.
- Electricity and gas meters send data every 5 minutes to the Smart Energy lab server.
- The data is visualized in a web application, showing real-time energy consumption.

The application provides real-time energy data, essential for gaining insights into energy consumption. This helps in optimizing energy use and minimizing strain on the power grid, contributing positively to the energy transition by moving towards sustainable, green energy sources.

### PROJECT ROBOTICS PROTOTYPING (L1Q2)

- Designed and built a robot capable of detecting and monitoring the health of plants.
- Constructed using a Raspberry Pi, an Arduino, and various sensors.
- Programmed to navigate alongside plants, assess their health, and avoid obstacles.
- Provides valuable data on plant health to optimize care and improve growth conditions.
- The system enhances agricultural practices by offering insights into plant health and growth.

The web application provides real-time data on plant health, essential for optimizing care and improving growth conditions. This helps in enhancing agricultural practices by offering valuable insights into plant health and growth, contributing positively to sustainable (pixel)farming practices.

### PROJECT 2D GRAPHICS & SECURE COMMUNICATION (L1Q3)
