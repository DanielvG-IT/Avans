## ‚öôÔ∏è Projects

### PROJECT SMART ENERGY (L1Q1)

- Designed and installed a Smart Meter Gateway in my own meter cabinet.
- Soldered the hardware and flashed the software independently.
- Electricity and gas meters send data every 5 minutes to the Smart Energy lab server.
- The data is visualized in a web application, showing real-time energy consumption.

The application provides real-time energy data, essential for gaining insights into energy consumption. This helps in optimizing energy use and minimizing strain on the power grid, contributing positively to the energy transition by moving towards sustainable, green energy sources.

### PROJECT ROBOTICS PROTOTYPING (L1Q2)

- Designed and built a robot capable of detecting and monitoring the health of plants.
- Constructed using a Raspberry Pi, an Arduino, and various sensors.
- Programmed to navigate alongside plants, assess their health, and avoid obstacles.
- Provides valuable data on plant health to optimize care and improve growth conditions.
- The system enhances agricultural practices by offering insights into plant health and growth.

The web application provides real-time data on plant health, essential for optimizing care and improving growth conditions. This helps in enhancing agricultural practices by offering valuable insights into plant health and growth, contributing positively to sustainable (pixel)farming practices.

### PROJECT 2D GRAPHICS & SECURE COMMUNICATION (L1Q3)

This 2D Unity-based project, developed under the scope of L1Q3, merges immersive visuals to provide an engaging educational experience for children facing medical procedures. By simulating a virtual hospital environment, youngsters can explore various scenarios, learn about common healthcare routines, and practice essential coping strategies. The secure communication layer, built with a .NET Web API, ensures that any sensitive data exchanged between the client application and the remote server is encrypted and protected from unauthorized access. Through this functionality, user progress, achievements, and interactive session details are reliably tracked, allowing caregivers and healthcare professionals to tailor support and resources when necessary. 

In addition to reinforcing hospital familiarity, the project prioritizes user privacy and data integrity by leveraging standardized encryption protocols, such as TLS, for network connections. This approach not only complies with standard data protection frameworks but also helps maintain a trustworthy environment where personal information remains confidential. By combining compelling graphics, playful animations, and user-centric design principles, the application motivates children to learn about healthcare processes in a stress-free manner. 

Ultimately, this interactive system aims to demystify hospital experiences, reduce anxiety, and foster positive associations with medical care, helping children approach their healthcare encounters with confidence and understanding.

### PROJECT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE & DATA SCIENCE (L1Q4)

TODO: Write a description about L1Q4 LU1
