# Robotics Prototyping Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Robotics Prototyping project for the second quarter of the first year at Avans School. This project is designed to provide students with hands-on experience in designing, building, and programming robotic systems. Throughout this project, you will apply theoretical knowledge from your coursework to create functional prototypes of robotic systems.
